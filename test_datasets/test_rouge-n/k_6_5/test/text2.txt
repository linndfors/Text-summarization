(1921). He demonstrated that if the intensity of electric force were inversely proportional to distance, then the electric fluid more than that needed for electrical neutrality would lie on the outer surface of an electrified sphere; then he confirmed this experimentally. Historian of science Russell McCormmach proposed that "Heat" is the only 18th-century work prefiguring thermodynamics. John Henry Poynting later noted that the data should have led to a value of 5.448,[18] and indeed that is the average value of the twenty-nine determinations Cavendish included in his paper. The University of Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory was endowed by one of Cavendish's later relatives, William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire (Chancellor of the University from 1861 to 1891).
