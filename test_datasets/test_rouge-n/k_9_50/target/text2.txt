A brig is a type of sailing vessel defined by its rig: two masts which are both square-rigged.
Brigs originated in the second half of the 18th century and were a common type of smaller merchant vessel or warship from then until the latter part of the 19th century.
In commercial use, they were gradually replaced by fore-and-aft rigged vessels such as schooners, as owners sought to reduce crew costs by having rigs that could be handled by fewer men.
In Royal Navy use, brigs were retained for training use when the battle fleets consisted almost entirely of iron-hulled steamships.
Brigs were prominent in the coasting coal trade of British waters.
4,395 voyages to London with coal were recorded in 1795.
With an average of eight or nine trips per year for one vessel, that is a fleet of over 500 colliers trading to London alone.
In the first half of the 19th century, the vast majority were rigged as brigs, and that rig was retained for longer in the northeast of England.
In sailing, a full-rigged brig is a vessel with two square rigged masts (fore and main).
The main mast of a brig is the aft one.
To improve maneuverability, the mainmast carries a small (gaff rigged) fore-and-aft sail.
Brig sails are named after the masts to which they are attached: the mainsail; above that the main topsail; above that the main topgallant sail; and occasionally a very small sail, called the royal, is above that.
Behind the main sail, there is a small fore-and-aft sail called the spanker or boom mainsail.
On the foremast is a similar sail, called the trysail.
Attached to the respective yards of square-rigged ships are smaller spars, which can be extended, thus lengthening the yard, thus receiving an additional sailing wing on each side.
These are called studding sails and are used with fair and light wind only.
The wings are named after the sails to which they are fastened, i.e., the main studding sails, main top studding sails, and the main top gallant studding sails, etc.
The brig's foremast is smaller than the main mast.
The fore mast holds a fore sail, fore top sail, fore top gallant sail, and fore royal.
Between the fore mast and the bowsprit are the fore staysail, jib, and flying jib.
All the yards are manipulated by a complicated arrangement of cordage named the running rigging.
A brig is "generally built on a larger scale than a schooner, and may approach the magnitude of a full-sized, three-masted ship."
Brigs vary in length between 75 and 165 ft (23 and 50 m) with tonnages up to 480.
Historically, most brigs were made of wood, although some later brigs were built with hulls and masts of steel or iron.
The word "brig" has been used in the past as an abbreviation of brigantine.
The brig actually developed as a variant of the brigantine.
The square-rigged brig's advantage over the fore-and-aft rigged brigantine was "that the sails, being smaller and more numerous, are more easily managed, and require fewer men or 'hands' to work them."
Brigs were used as small warships carrying about
10 to 18 guns.
Due to their speed and maneuverability, they were popular among pirates.

One of the most famous periods for the brig was during the 19th century when they were involved in famous naval battles such as the Battle of Lake Erie.
The brig was a standard cargo ship in the early 19th century.
Brigs were seen as more maneuverable than schooners.
James Cook requested the conversion of the schooner HMS Grenfell to a brig.
The windward ability of brigs could be comparable to or better than contemporary schooners.
A brig's square-rig had the advantage over a fore-and-aftâ€“rigged vessel when traveling offshore, in the trade winds.
The need for large crews in relation to their relatively small size led to the decline of the production of brigs.
HMS Pilot, USS Argus, Archer, USS Oneida, the cargo-hauling brig Farmer, the cargo-hauling brig Fleetwing, and the Bonanza of Liverpool are examples of brigs.
Leonora, Mercury, USS Niagara, USS Oregon, the cargo brig Pilgrim, Potomac, Rebecca, USS Reprisal, USS Somers, and HMS Beagle are other examples of brigs.
Jean Lafitte's pirate brig, the Pride, and HMS Badger are notable examples of brigs.
Wharton, Joel Root, and Rover are additional examples of brigs.
HMS Temeraire, NMS Mircea, and the Telos are examples of brigs with specific historical significance.
The famous mystery ship Mary Celeste, while sometimes called a brig, was clearly a brigantine.
Brigs played a significant role in naval battles and conflicts, including the War of 1812, the Mexican-American War, and the First Barbary War.
The brig USS Somers was sunk during the Mexican-American War.
The cargo-hauling brig Farmer was owned by George Washington.
The brig USS Reprisal fought in the American Revolution.
The HMS Beagle, initially built as a brig, embarked on a renowned exploration voyage with Charles Darwin.
The brig Rover was a privateer known for its bold battles during the Napoleonic Wars.
The brig USS Oregon was used in the U.S. Exploring Expedition.
The Mary Celeste, although commonly referred to as a brig, was actually a brigantine, adding to the mystery surrounding its infamous disappearance.
