(1921). About the time of his father's death, Cavendish began to work closely with Charles Blagden, an association that helped Blagden enter fully into London's scientific society. Antoine Lavoisier later reproduced Cavendish's experiment and gave the element its name. As his biographer, George Wilson, comments, "As to Cavendish's religion, he was nothing at all. At his death, Cavendish was the largest depositor in the Bank of England. By one account, Cavendish had a back staircase added to his house to avoid encountering his housekeeper, because he was especially shy of women. Cavendish inherited two fortunes that were so large that Jean Baptiste Biot called him "the richest of all the savants and the most knowledgeable of the rich". Cavendish published no books and few papers, but he achieved much. Cavendish reported his findings to Priestley no later than March 1783, but did not publish them until the following year. Cavendish seldom missed these meetings, and was profoundly respected by his contemporaries. Cavendish was taciturn and solitary and regarded by many as eccentric. Cavendish's electrical and chemical experiments, like those on heat, had begun while he lived with his father in a laboratory in their London house. Cavendish's electrical papers from the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London have been reprinted, together with most of his electrical manuscripts, in The Scientific Papers of the Honourable Henry Cavendish, F.R.S. Cavendish's work led others to accurate values for the gravitational constant (G) and Earth's mass. Examples of what was included in Cavendish's discoveries or anticipations were Richter's law of reciprocal proportions, Ohm's law, Dalton's law of partial pressures, principles of electrical conductivity (including Coulomb's law), and Charles's Law of gases. Furthermore, he also described an experiment in which he was able to remove, in modern terminology, both the oxygen and nitrogen gases from a sample of atmospheric air until only a small bubble of unreacted gas was left in the original sample. He could speak to only one person at a time, and only if the person were known to him and male. He demonstrated that if the intensity of electric force were inversely proportional to distance, then the electric fluid more than that needed for electrical neutrality would lie on the outer surface of an electrified sphere; then he confirmed this experimentally. He then measured their solubility in water and their specific gravity, and noted their combustibility. He was a shy man who was uncomfortable in society and avoided it when he could. He was considered to be agnostic. He went on to develop a general theory of heat, and the manuscript of that theory has been persuasively dated to the late 1780s. Henry's mother died in 1733, three months after the birth of her second son, Frederick, and shortly before Henry's second birthday, leaving Lord Charles Cavendish to bring up his two sons. His experiment to measure the density of the Earth (which, in turn, allows the gravitational constant to be calculated) has come to be known as the Cavendish experiment. His first paper, Factitious Airs, appeared in 1766. His interest and expertise in the use of scientific instruments led him to head a committee to review the Royal Society's meteorological instruments and to help assess the instruments of the Royal Greenwich Observatory. His theory was at once mathematical and mechanical: it contained the principle of the conservation of heat (later understood as an instance of conservation of energy) and even included the concept (although not the label) of the mechanical equivalent of heat. Historian of science Russell McCormmach proposed that "Heat" is the only 18th-century work prefiguring thermodynamics. However, his shyness made those who "sought his views... speak as if into vacancy. In 1760, Henry Cavendish was elected to both these groups, and he was assiduous in his attendance after that. In 1777, Cavendish discovered that air exhaled by mammals is converted to "fixed air" (carbon dioxide), not "phlogisticated air" as predicted by Joseph Priestley. In 1787, he became one of the earliest outside France to convert to the new antiphlogistic theory of Lavoisier, though he remained sceptical about the nomenclature of the new theory. In return, Blagden helped to keep the world at a distance from Cavendish. In the late nineteenth century, long after his death, James Clerk Maxwell looked through Cavendish's papers and found observations and results for which others had been given credit. John Henry Poynting later noted that the data should have led to a value of 5.448,[18] and indeed that is the average value of the twenty-nine determinations Cavendish included in his paper. Lord Charles Cavendish died in 1783, leaving almost all of his very substantial estate to Henry. Several areas of research, including mechanics, optics, and magnetism, feature extensively in his manuscripts, but they scarcely feature in his published work. Some physicists interpreted hydrogen as pure phlogiston. Soon after the Royal Institution of Great Britain was established, Cavendish became a manager (1800) and took an active interest, especially in the laboratory, where he observed and helped in Humphry Davy's chemical experiments. The Scottish inventor James Watt published a paper on the composition of water in 1783; controversy about who made the discovery first ensued. The University of Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory was endowed by one of Cavendish's later relatives, William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire (Chancellor of the University from 1861 to 1891). The apparatus Cavendish used for weighing the Earth was a modification of the torsion balance built by Englishman and geologist John Michell, who died before he could begin the experiment. The balance that he used, made by a craftsman named Harrison, was the first of the precision balances of the 18th century, and as accurate as Lavoisier's (which has been estimated to measure one part in 400,000). The road he used to live on in Derby has been named after him. This gas was hydrogen, which Cavendish correctly guessed was proportioned two to one in water. What he had done was perform rigorous quantitative experiments, using standardised instruments and methods, aimed at reproducible results; taken the mean of the result of several experiments; and identified and allowed for sources of error. [1] He described the density of inflammable air, which formed water on combustion, in a 1766 paper, On Factitious Airs. [22] Books often describe Cavendish's work as a measurement of either G or the Earth's mass. [33] He conversed little, always dressed in an old-fashioned suit, and developed no known deep personal attachments outside his family. [7][8][9] Cavendish concluded that rather than being synthesised, the burning of hydrogen caused water to be condensed from the air.
