Henry Cavendish FRS (/ˈkævəndɪʃ/ KAV-ən-dish; 10 October 1731 – 24 February 1810) was an English natural philosopher and scientist who was an important experimental and theoretical chemist and physicist.
He is noted for his discovery of hydrogen, which he termed "inflammable air".
He described the density of inflammable air, which formed water on combustion, in a 1766 paper, On Factitious Airs.
Antoine Lavoisier later reproduced Cavendish's experiment and gave the element its name.
A shy man, Cavendish was distinguished for great accuracy and precision in his researches into the composition of atmospheric air, the properties of different gases, the synthesis of water, the law governing electrical attraction and repulsion, a mechanical theory of heat, and calculations of the density (and hence the mass) of the Earth.
His experiment to measure the density of the Earth (which, in turn, allows the gravitational constant to be calculated) has come to be known as the Cavendish experiment.
Henry Cavendish was born on 10 October 1731 in Nice, where his family was living at the time.
His mother was Lady Anne de Grey, fourth daughter of Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Kent, and his father was Lord Charles Cavendish, the third son of William Cavendish, 2nd Duke of Devonshire.
Henry Cavendish was styled as "The Honourable Henry Cavendish".
From the age of 11 Henry attended Newcome's School, a private school near London.
At the age of 18 (on 24 November 1748) he entered the University of Cambridge in St Peter's College, now known as Peterhouse, but left three years later on 23 February 1751 without taking a degree (at the time, a common practice).
Lord Charles Cavendish spent his life firstly in politics and then increasingly in science, especially in the Royal Society of London.
In 1758, he took Henry to meetings of the Royal Society and also to dinners of the Royal Society Club.
In 1760, Henry Cavendish was elected to both these groups, and he was assiduous in his attendance after that.
His first paper, Factitious Airs, appeared in 1766.
Other committees on which he served included the committee of papers, which chose the papers for publication in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, and the committees for the transit of Venus (1769), for the gravitational attraction of mountains (1774), and for the scientific instructions for Constantine Phipps's expedition (1773) in search of the North Pole and the Northwest Passage.
In 1773, Henry joined his father as an elected trustee of the British Museum, to which he devoted a good deal of time and effort.
About the time of his father's death, Cavendish began to work closely with Charles Blagden, an association that helped Blagden enter fully into London's scientific society.
Cavendish found that a definite, peculiar, and highly inflammable gas, which he referred to as "Inflammable Air", was produced by the action of certain acids on certain metals.
Although others, such as Robert Boyle, had prepared hydrogen gas earlier, Cavendish is usually given the credit for recognizing its elemental
