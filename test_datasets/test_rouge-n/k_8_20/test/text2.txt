(1921). Antoine Lavoisier later reproduced Cavendish's experiment and gave the element its name. Cavendish inherited two fortunes that were so large that Jean Baptiste Biot called him "the richest of all the savants and the most knowledgeable of the rich". Cavendish published no books and few papers, but he achieved much. Furthermore, he also described an experiment in which he was able to remove, in modern terminology, both the oxygen and nitrogen gases from a sample of atmospheric air until only a small bubble of unreacted gas was left in the original sample. He could speak to only one person at a time, and only if the person were known to him and male. He demonstrated that if the intensity of electric force were inversely proportional to distance, then the electric fluid more than that needed for electrical neutrality would lie on the outer surface of an electrified sphere; then he confirmed this experimentally. He then measured their solubility in water and their specific gravity, and noted their combustibility. Henry's mother died in 1733, three months after the birth of her second son, Frederick, and shortly before Henry's second birthday, leaving Lord Charles Cavendish to bring up his two sons. His first paper, Factitious Airs, appeared in 1766. His interest and expertise in the use of scientific instruments led him to head a committee to review the Royal Society's meteorological instruments and to help assess the instruments of the Royal Greenwich Observatory. Historian of science Russell McCormmach proposed that "Heat" is the only 18th-century work prefiguring thermodynamics. In 1760, Henry Cavendish was elected to both these groups, and he was assiduous in his attendance after that. John Henry Poynting later noted that the data should have led to a value of 5.448,[18] and indeed that is the average value of the twenty-nine determinations Cavendish included in his paper. Several areas of research, including mechanics, optics, and magnetism, feature extensively in his manuscripts, but they scarcely feature in his published work. The University of Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory was endowed by one of Cavendish's later relatives, William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire (Chancellor of the University from 1861 to 1891). The balance that he used, made by a craftsman named Harrison, was the first of the precision balances of the 18th century, and as accurate as Lavoisier's (which has been estimated to measure one part in 400,000). [1] He described the density of inflammable air, which formed water on combustion, in a 1766 paper, On Factitious Airs. [22] Books often describe Cavendish's work as a measurement of either G or the Earth's mass. [33] He conversed little, always dressed in an old-fashioned suit, and developed no known deep personal attachments outside his family.
