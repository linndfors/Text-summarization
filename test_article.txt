As a kid, I grew up in North Africa as a Jewish woman. Morocco was owned by France for nearly 40 years and I was born during that timeline. Growing up, all the schools were heavily France-influenced because of their imperialization. Most of the topics we learned about were about France and we even had to learn French. I made the most out of that. Once we gained our independence, everything felt foreign. Morocco soon became an Arabic country. In high school, we had an hour a day dedicated to learning Arabic and English. Jobs didn’t provide enough money for people anymore so people began to leave and migrate to places that offered them better job opportunities and a better life for their families. Europeans went back to France, Arabs emigrated to Spain or France, and Jews went to Israel and France. 
“When it’s time to go, it’s time to go.” I would hear my parents say. 
My husband and I had the option to go to France or Israel but I chose the United States because my husband earned a job contract there so we seized the opportunity. I often saw films about the American lifestyle and listened to American music. By the time I was leaving, we had no family left in Morocco. My parents and my sister left three months before us to France and the rest of my siblings emigrated to Israel which made it difficult to go our separate ways because growing up with my siblings was a fun experience. I am the second oldest of seven of my siblings. There are 21 years between my youngest brother and I. My mom got married at 14 and we lived a good life though there were a lot of us.
